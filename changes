advanced games states management:
  some of those might not be true! check it out!!!
  doing one of the following actions in web or mobile:
    a. starting a new game 
    b. changing any setting
    c. log in/out
  while a game is in/active, will cause all of the following to happen:
    1. reassign existing cookies/SecureStorage on login and reomving them on logout - already happens auto in all scenarios
    2. reset front gameData - manually imp in three scenarios
    3. reset redis states - if sessionId remains the same, it's reassigned in shuffleNDeal when creating a new game, otherwise the redis values from prev game are simply expired.
       in other words, there is no need to create a special express listener to clear redis values - already happens auto in all scenarios
    4. clear running timer if game mode is 3 min speedrun with clearTimeout - manually imp in three scenarios
