- store data fetched from cloud after auyth in Redis, and after page refresh, fetch it from redis instead from the cloud to save time
I have decided NOT to imp the above think it's unnecessarily complicated, make sure u include it in the final project notes

- how to view ALL problems from the activitgy bar in temrinal, like with npm run lint? I can't! put it in the final project notes
- make .gitignore work! can't do either....

other tasks:
- final restyling improvements for the far far future:
  1. if u want u can put the stack next to the board, creating a nice animation for dealing and shuffling
  2. u can redesign the stats popup, making the text nicer and actual words with meaning
- ospeedruns
- rename FGS in App.vue
-make sure express requests are all valid
- deploy app - do not hardcode the fetch adresses, make sure they are defaulted to express localhost in .env! IMPORTANT good pratice! don't overlook!
- make sure AtlasDB is widely accessible


workflow:
1. expo app
2. multiplayer
3. AI for detecting sets
4. final touches plus other tasks
