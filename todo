- redesign stats pop up for web
- note that: no session persistant for google/otp in both versions, and google auth doesn't work in mobile version
  while secure storage works, I cannot omit cookies, which are present in expo go which uses WebView comp, from the request.
   The cookies are stored after successful OTP validtaion, AND the secure storage is modified as well.
   the on-mount-fetch conditional detects two scenarios: web cookies exist AND secure storage sessionId exists. Two requests. And while the app
   could theoretically work if I fetch the data from the secure-storage condition, It's more difficult to debug when there are multiple blocks involved...
  For google auth session persistance in web version:
    the email is saved in req.session.passport.email and for some reason disappears after front refresh!


workflow:
1. expo app - DONE!
2. multiplayer
3. AI for detecting sets
4. final touches plus other tasks
