in settings dialog commit: interactive rebase is in order DONT FORGET TO BACKUP:
    create settings dialog for expo as well

new commit - imp new security in redis game state and user logins
  auth all requests with new middleware func - credentials include / pass expo-secure-store for each request
  if a user has a guest session then logs in, make sure to imp the following in the three auth paths:
    in this scneario since sessionId and temp game data is all we have in those, we can simply clear all in both.
    a. delete the session from redis - optional AND i THINK IT COULD PREVENT BUGS IF LOGGING IN WHILE GAMES IS ACTIVE IS TAKING PLACE!
    b. delete the session from cookies/expo-secure-state
  replace errorData.message with errorData.error to properly access the error message in both fronts
  restructure valdiate function in GameBoard.tsx (mobile)
  remove req.isSessionValid conditionals from routes and the middleware func
  tag single player games temp redis data with the sessionId to handle nuemours parallel games

next commit:
  delete game session on game over
  use newly imp security to manage two game modes:
  check when the game is over for each of the game modes and check for new records

then the path is clear for multiplayer!
for multiplayer, use web sockest, to avoid collisions lock the socket until the current request is completed


three auth strategies:
google web - auth/callback
otp web - validateOTPRoute
otp mobile validateOTPRoute
