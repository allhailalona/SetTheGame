next commit:
  for 3min speedrun - 
    a. a timer is required - possible approaches:
      1. expiring redis key and a websocket that listens to it then notifies the front?
      2. just websocket storage?
    b. every new validated set increments sessinId:foundSets by one
    c. when the game over (redis expires and detected by socket   ) notification is recieved from the server we stop the game:


then the path is clear for multiplayer!
I'm thinking redis sixDigits:availableSessionsIds then seperate sixDigis:boardFeed sixDigit:shuffledStack etc... perhaps add a flag to each function?
for multiplayer, use web sockest, to avoid collisions lock the socket until the current request is completed
use a six digit for multiplayer games, while storing two sessionsId inside to handle accessibility permissions
